  First of all to run this you will need =pillow= or =PIL= and
  =numpy=. Both are installable frim pypi with =easy_install= or
  =pip=. You may also need to create empty directories =boxed= and
  =shady=. Really easy:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ mkdir shady boxed
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage
   Just run imager.py with the image sequence as arguments.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   python imager.py Sequence_1/*.png
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   This will generate the following:

   - A copy of the original image sequence with the bounding box around
     the figure in the =boxed= directory.
   - A copy of the sequence where the pixels that qualify as figure as
     white in the =shady= directory.
   - The background of the image =bg.png=

   Note: While the script is quite fast there are a couple of obvious
   further optimizations. For example once the background is computed
   once the script doesnt try to recalculate it inless =bg.png= is
   removed.

   Here are a couple of images to please your eyes
*** Bounding boxes

    #+CAPTION: Bounding-boxed image 1
    #+NAME:   fig:boxed1
    [[./boxed/img0000.png]]

    #+CAPTION: Bounding-boxed image 51
    #+NAME:   fig:boxed2
    [[./boxed/img0050.png]]

    #+CAPTION: Bounding-boxed image 101
    #+NAME:   fig:boxed3
    [[./boxed/img0100.png]]

    #+CAPTION: Bounding-boxed image 141
    #+NAME:   fig:boxed4
    [[./boxed/img0140.png]]

*** Shades

   #+CAPTION: Shaded image 1
   #+NAME:   fig:shaded1
   [[./shady/img0000.png]]

   #+CAPTION: Shaded image 51
   #+NAME:   fig:shaded2
   [[./shady/img0050.png]]

   #+CAPTION: Shaded image 101
   #+NAME:   fig:boxed3
   [[./shady/img0100.png]]

   #+CAPTION: Shaded image 141
   #+NAME:   fig:shaded4
   [[./shady/img0140.png]]

** Width and height
   I used gnuplont and wrote =plotter.gplt= to plot the width and
   height data so here it goes.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ gnuplot plotter.gplt
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   #+CAPTION: Plot the stride of the figure
   #+NAME:   fig:stride_plot.png
   [[./stride_plot.png]]

   #+CAPTION: Plot the height of the figure
   #+NAME:   fig:height_plot.png
   [[./height_plot.png]]

   Note that the peak is due to reflection on the drain cover. Fine
   tuning the threshhold should fix that.

   An estimate of the period is printed by imager but it may be
   inaccurate.
